# Future Age Calculator

# Step 1: Prompt the user for their current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Step 2: Calculate the user's age in 2050
years_to_add = 2050 - 2023  # Difference between 2050 and the current year
future_age = current_age + years_to_add

# Step 3: Print the result
print(f"In 2050, you will be {future_age} years old.")
